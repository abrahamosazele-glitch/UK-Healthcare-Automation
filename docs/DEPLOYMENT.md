# Deployment

Four ways to run this app in production: Railway, Render, plain Docker (any
VPS/host that can run a container), and a bare VPS with no container at all.
All four run the exact same app — the differences are only in how the
process is started, how Postgres is provisioned, and how HTTPS/health
checks are wired up.

This app has no separate worker process. The background scheduler
(`SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true`) runs inside the same process as the web server
(`APScheduler`, started from `web/app.py`'s `lifespan`) — there is nothing
else to deploy. This does mean the process must stay running continuously;
a platform that scales a service to zero between requests (most serverless
"scale to zero" tiers) will silently stop the daily job-ingestion refresh
and closing-soon-job checks. Pick an "always-on" tier/plan for the same
reason.

## Before deploying anywhere

1. **Generate a real session secret** — the app refuses to start with
   `ENVIRONMENT=production` while `SESSION_SECRET_KEY` is still at its
   development default (see `config/settings.py`'s
   `_validate_production_config`):
   ```
   python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
   ```
2. **Decide your database.** SQLite (the dev default) works fine for a
   single-instance deployment with a persistent disk, but most of the
   platforms below either don't offer persistent disks by default or make
   a managed Postgres instance the natural choice. See
   [PostgreSQL](#postgresql) below — this was verified (schema
   compatibility, timezone handling) during the Production Readiness
   milestone, though a real Postgres connection was never available
   inside the sandbox that built this feature; verify it for real on your
   own machine per that section.
3. **Set every production-relevant env var** — copy `.env.example`,
   fill in real values. At minimum for a working deployment:
   `ENVIRONMENT=production`, `SESSION_SECRET_KEY`,
   `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true` (once served over HTTPS — true on every
   platform below except a VPS without a reverse proxy in front of it),
   `DATABASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (optional — the app runs without
   real AI, just without generating real documents), `REED_API_KEY` and/or
   `TRAC_JOBS_BASE_URL` (optional — see docs/JOB_INGESTION.md).
4. **Never commit `.env`.** Every platform below has its own place to set
   secrets (Railway variables, Render environment groups, a `.env` file
   on a VPS with restrictive file permissions).

## PostgreSQL

`DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname` — `psycopg2-binary`
is already in `requirements.txt`. Everything else is automatic:

- `alembic upgrade head` creates the exact same schema on Postgres as on
  SQLite — including migration `c38bf18c2826`, which makes every
  timestamp column naive (`TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE`), matching this
  app's naive-UTC-everywhere convention. Without that migration, Postgres
  would hand back timezone-*aware* datetimes and crash the first time one
  was compared against `utils.helpers.utc_now()`. See
  `database/mixins.py`'s docstring for the full explanation.
- `db_manager.py`'s engine is created with `pool_pre_ping=True`, so a
  connection a managed Postgres instance has quietly closed after being
  idle doesn't surface as a random mid-request error.
- Every search filter uses `.ilike()`, not `.like()` — SQLAlchemy compiles
  this to Postgres's native case-insensitive `ILIKE`, not a
  `LOWER(...) LIKE LOWER(...)` workaround, so behavior matches SQLite's
  case-insensitive `LIKE` without any dialect-specific code.
- **Set the database's session timezone to UTC.** `created_at`/`updated_at`
  use `server_default=func.now()` — evaluated inside Postgres itself, so
  it follows Postgres's session timezone, not Python's. Most managed
  Postgres providers default to UTC already; if yours doesn't, either set
  it at the database level (`ALTER DATABASE dbname SET timezone TO 'UTC'`)
  or append `?options=-c%20timezone%3DUTC` to `DATABASE_URL`.

**This was verified by compiling every table's DDL and several of the
more complex analytics queries against SQLAlchemy's `postgresql` dialect,
running the full migration chain (including a downgrade/upgrade round
trip) against a fresh SQLite file, and a static audit for
Postgres-incompatible SQL (none found — no raw `PRAGMA`/dialect-specific
functions outside `db_manager.py`'s already-SQLite-gated one). It was
**not** verified against a real running Postgres server — this sandbox
has no internet access and no local Postgres install. Before trusting a
production deployment, run `alembic upgrade head` against your real
`DATABASE_URL` once and confirm the app behaves normally (log in, view
the dashboard, run `scripts/verify_live_production.py`).**

## Docker

The `Dockerfile` at the repo root builds the app, installs Playwright's
Chromium (NHS Jobs/Trac Jobs ingestion launches a real headless browser —
not optional), and runs `alembic upgrade head` on every container start
(`docker-entrypoint.sh`) before starting `uvicorn`.

### Local Docker Compose (app + Postgres)

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # fill in real values
docker compose up --build
```

`docker-compose.yml` starts a local Postgres container and points the app
at it automatically — useful for exercising the Postgres path (see
above) without a managed cloud database. `./data` and `./logs` are
volume-mounted so generated documents and log files survive a container
restart.

### Any other Docker host (a VPS, a self-managed server)

```bash
docker build -t job-automation .
docker run -d --name job-automation \
  --env-file .env \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  -v $(pwd)/logs:/app/logs \
  job-automation
```

Put a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) in front for HTTPS/TLS — the container
itself only serves plain HTTP on port 8000. The image's `HEALTHCHECK`
hits `/health` every 30s; `docker ps` shows the resulting health status.

**Not build-tested in this sandbox** (no `docker` binary and no internet
access to pull the base image) — build it once on your own machine before
relying on it: `docker build -t job-automation .` should complete without
errors, and `docker run --rm job-automation python -c "import job_automation"`
should succeed.

## Railway

Railway builds directly from a `Dockerfile` in the repo root — no
additional build configuration needed.

1. Create a new Railway project, add this repo as a service (Railway
   detects the `Dockerfile` automatically).
2. Add a Postgres plugin to the project. Railway injects `DATABASE_URL`
   automatically in the `postgresql://...` form this app expects — no
   manual wiring needed.
3. Set the remaining environment variables (`ENVIRONMENT=production`,
   `SESSION_SECRET_KEY`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
   etc.) under the service's Variables tab.
4. Under Settings, set the health check path to `/health` — Railway polls
   it during and after each deploy and rolls back a deploy that never
   turns healthy.
5. Railway's generated domain is served over HTTPS by default, so
   `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true` is correct from the start.
6. Since there's no separate worker, one Railway service is the entire
   deployment. Pick a plan/replica count that doesn't sleep the service —
   the in-process scheduler needs to keep running.

## Render

Render also builds directly from a `Dockerfile`.

1. Create a new **Web Service**, point it at this repo, and set the
   runtime to **Docker** (Render detects the `Dockerfile` automatically).
2. Create a **Render Postgres** instance (or bring your own) and copy its
   internal connection string into `DATABASE_URL`.
3. Add the remaining environment variables under the service's
   Environment tab — or, if running multiple services, an Environment
   Group shared between them.
4. Set the health check path to `/health` in the service settings.
5. Render's default `.onrender.com` domain is HTTPS — `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true`
   is correct immediately.
6. Use an "always on" instance type, not one that spins down on
   inactivity — same reasoning as Railway: the in-process scheduler needs
   a continuously-running process.

## VPS (no Docker)

For a plain Ubuntu/Debian VPS running Python directly:

```bash
git clone <this-repo> /opt/job-automation
cd /opt/job-automation
python3.13 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python -m playwright install --with-deps chromium

cp .env.example .env   # fill in real values, including a real DATABASE_URL
.venv/bin/python -m alembic upgrade head
```

Run it under a process manager so it restarts on crash/reboot — a
`systemd` unit is the simplest option:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/job-automation.service
[Unit]
Description=UK Healthcare Job Automation
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/opt/job-automation
EnvironmentFile=/opt/job-automation/.env
ExecStart=/opt/job-automation/.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn job_automation.web.app:app --app-dir src --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now job-automation
```

Put nginx (or Caddy) in front for HTTPS — `certbot --nginx` is the
standard way to get a free TLS certificate — and only then set
`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true`; a `Secure` cookie is never sent back by the
browser over plain HTTP, which silently breaks login if set too early.
Point nginx's own health check (or an uptime monitor) at `/health`.

## After deploying, on any platform

1. **Run the live-provider verification runbook** from a machine with
   real internet access (this project's own sandbox never had any — see
   docs/JOB_INGESTION.md's "Manual live verification" section for how
   that was established):
   ```bash
   python scripts/verify_live_production.py --yes
   ```
   This runs the exact same ingestion + auto-match code path the daily
   scheduled task uses, against your real `DATABASE_URL`, and reports a
   per-provider summary. Configure `REED_API_KEY`/`TRAC_JOBS_BASE_URL`
   first (see docs/JOB_INGESTION.md) — without them, Reed/Trac Jobs will
   report a clear per-provider error rather than importing anything,
   while NHS Jobs (no API key needed) still runs.
2. **Log in and click through the app** — dashboard, job search, AI
   matches, generate a document, view the scheduler page. `/health`
   should report `{"status": "ok", "database": "ok", ...}`.
3. **Turn on the scheduler** (`SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true`) once you're
   satisfied ingestion works — this is what makes the daily
   NHS/Trac/Reed refresh, AI auto-matching, and closing-soon
   notifications actually run without anyone clicking a button.
